/**
 * The {@code Dictionary} class is the abstract parent of any
 * class, such as {@code Hashtable}, which maps keys to values.
 * Every key and every value is an object. In any one {@code Dictionary}
 * object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a
 * {@code Dictionary} and a key, the associated element can be looked up.
 * Any non-{@code null} object can be used as a key and as a value.
 * <p>
 * As a rule, the {@code equals} method should be used by
 * implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should
 * implement the Map interface, rather than extending this class.</strong>
